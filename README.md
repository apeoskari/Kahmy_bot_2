Bot is developed using Python version 3.12 and needed packages for run the project are flask and requests.

To help with the usage it is also recommended to tap from the forum API settings "retry web hook events". This ensures that if the messaging to the chat fails, the forum will try to push an update again (in 1, 5, 25 and 125 minutes) until successfull.
This way even if something breaks, every message should get through and as a last resort from the logs, you can manually push individual events again.
